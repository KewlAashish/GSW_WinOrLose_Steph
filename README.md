# GSW_WinOrLose_Steph
Model which predicts if Golden State Warriors is winning or losing according to Stephen Curry's stats of that match.
This model is finalised by first  training our dataset on various classification model and then making future prediction of games according to curry's stats of that match.
Finally I came up with the solution that the best accuracy is shown when the model is trained with logistic regression algorithm
